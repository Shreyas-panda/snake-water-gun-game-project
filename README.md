# snake-water-gun-game-project
This Python-based Snake, Water, Gun game lets players choose between Snake (1), Water (-1), or Gun (0), while the computer randomly selects its choice. The game compares both choices and declares a winner based on simple rules. A great beginner project to practice Python logic and randomization!

"main.py" file contains the source code for the game. Enjoy!
